Wilson's Disease
Wilsonâ€™s Disease Overview
Wilson's disease is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene. This gene encodes a copper-transporting ATPase, which is essential for the excretion of excess copper into bile and its incorporation into ceruloplasmin. The defective ATP7B protein leads to copper accumulation in the liver, brain, eyes, and other tissues, causing severe damage.

Key Features
Symptoms:

Hepatic: Jaundice, hepatitis, cirrhosis, or acute liver failure.
Neurological: Tremors, dystonia, Parkinsonism-like symptoms, ataxia, and dysarthria.
Psychiatric: Depression, anxiety, mood swings, personality changes, and psychosis.
Ophthalmological: Kayser-Fleischer rings (copper deposits in the cornea).
Other: Renal dysfunction, hemolytic anemia, and joint problems.
Age of Onset:
Symptoms typically appear between 5 and 35 years old but may develop at any age.

Diagnosis:

Low ceruloplasmin levels.
Elevated urinary copper excretion.
High hepatic copper concentration (via liver biopsy).
Genetic testing for ATP7B mutations.
Slit-lamp examination for Kayser-Fleischer rings.
Prevalence:
Wilson's disease is estimated to affect about 1 in 30,000 people worldwide.

Current Treatments
Chelation Therapy:

Penicillamine: Binds copper, enhancing its excretion via urine.
Trientine: An alternative chelator with fewer side effects.
Zinc Therapy:

Inhibits copper absorption in the gastrointestinal tract.
Often used for maintenance therapy after initial stabilization.
Dietary Adjustments:

Avoid copper-rich foods such as shellfish, liver, nuts, and chocolate.
Monitor water sources for copper contamination.
Liver Transplant:

For severe liver failure cases unresponsive to medical therapy.
Research Areas
Gene Therapy:

CRISPR and other genetic approaches to correct ATP7B mutations.
Delivery systems for effective liver-targeted therapies.
Biomarkers:

Non-invasive methods for early diagnosis, especially in asymptomatic patients.
Monitoring treatment efficacy with precision biomarkers.
Drug Development:

New chelators with fewer side effects and greater efficacy.
Small molecules that restore ATP7B function or mitigate copper toxicity.
Patient Monitoring:

Development of wearable devices to track neurological or hepatic symptoms.
Apps or tools to aid in dietary and medication adherence.
Potential for Biohacking Projects
DIY Diagnostics: Develop affordable and accessible kits for detecting ceruloplasmin or copper levels in underserved areas.
Community Awareness: Create digital tools or platforms for patient education and symptom tracking.
Synthetic Biology: Engineer microbes to sequester copper in the gut, reducing absorption.
Precision Medicine: Use AI to analyze genetic and biochemical data to optimize treatment plans for individual patients.

Gene associated with disease: ATP7B

Primarily expressed in the liver but can also be expressed in brain, kidney, and placenta.
Expression starts in fetal development and continues throughout life. 
Encodes copper-transporting ATPase2, important for copper metabolism in body. 
   Helps withs incorporating copper into ceruloplasmin (protein that carries copper in the blood)
   Assists in removal of excess copper from liver cells into bile for excretion. 
In Wilsons Disease, the gene carries mutations that leads to a malfunctional protein.
   Copper fails to be properly incorporated into ceruloplasmin, causing low ceruloplasmin in blood. 
   Excess copper accumulates in liver and not effectively excreted into bile.
   With time, copper can accumulate in other organs (brain and kidney) leading to increase symptoms. 

Hypothesis: In Wilson's disease, mutations in the ATP7B gene disrupt copper metabolism, leading to tissue-specific alterations in protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and eQTL regulatory dynamics. These disruptions result in abnormal gene expression profiles, particularly in the liver and brain, driven by oxidative stress, epigenetic modifications, and feedback loops involving copper-sensitive pathways. These non-wild-type expression profiles correlate with tissue-specific disease phenotypes and highlight potential molecular targets for therapeutic intervention.
