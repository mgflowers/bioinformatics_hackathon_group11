### Introduction
Wilson's disease is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene. This gene encodes a copper-transporting ATPase, which is essential for the excretion of excess copper into bile and its incorporation into ceruloplasmin. The defective ATP7B protein leads to copper accumulation in the liver, brain, eyes, and other tissues, causing severe damage. A few symptoms of Wilson’s disease include hepatic (Jaundice, Hepatitis, Cirrhosis, and acute liver failure), neurological (tremors, dystonia, Parkinsons-like symptoms, ataxia, and dysarthria), psychiatric (depression, anxiety, mood swings, and psychosis), as well as many others. While symptoms may appear and develop at any age, they typically present between the ages of 5 and 35. Wilson’s disease affects many individuals and there is not a ton of information available about the causes and treatments. Wilson’s disease is contributed to a mutation in ATP7B.

### Hypothesis
In Wilson's disease, mutations in the ATP7B gene disrupt copper metabolism, leading to tissue-specific alterations in protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and eQTL regulatory dynamics. These disruptions result in abnormal gene expression profiles, particularly in the liver and brain, driven by oxidative stress, epigenetic modifications, and feedback loops involving copper-sensitive pathways. These non-wild-type expression profiles correlate with tissue-specific disease phenotypes and highlight potential molecular targets for therapeutic intervention.

### Methods
Using several different methods, we analyzed the impact of the ATP7B mutation. A protein:protein interaction network was created using the gene protein products as seeds. Several tissue-specific eQTL’s were then found to observe DNA polymorphisms that could potentially alter the expression of ATP7B. All of this data was then analyzed to learn more about the gene of interest. 

### Results

Our results for the PPI as well as the eQTL’s studied can be found in the other tabs of this github. Using the background research as well as the PPI and eQTL’s it was determined that the gene associated with disease ATP7B is primarily expressed in the liver but can also be expressed in brain, kidney, and placenta. Expression starts in fetal development and continues throughout life. ATP7B encodes copper-transporting ATPase2, important for copper metabolism in body, helps withs incorporating copper into ceruloplasmin (protein that carries copper in the blood), and assists in removal of excess copper from liver cells into bile for excretion. In Wilsons Disease, the gene carries mutations that leads to a malfunctional protein. Copper fails to be properly incorporated into ceruloplasmin, causing low ceruloplasmin in blood. Excess copper accumulates in liver and not effectively excreted into bile. With time, copper can accumulate in other organs (brain and kidney) leading to increase symptoms.

### Discussion
While there are a few treatments for Wilson’s disease, knowing more about the genetic mutation can improve treatments and overall well being of those affected. In Wilson's disease, mutations in the ATP7B gene disrupt copper metabolism, leading to tissue-specific alterations in protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and eQTL regulatory dynamics. These disruptions result in abnormal gene expression profiles, particularly in the liver and brain, driven by oxidative stress, epigenetic modifications, and feedback loops involving copper-sensitive pathways. These non-wild-type expression profiles correlate with tissue-specific disease phenotypes and highlight potential molecular targets for therapeutic intervention.
